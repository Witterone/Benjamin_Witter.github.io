**A Real Coding Challenge**
My project while learning general coding skills was to replicate a classifier using Bayesian Probability.
I worked very hard in solving all the problems involved with the project and accoplished a working model.
I created the predictive modeling program to function very similarly to the standard module.
[repository with my file here](https://github.com/Witterone/Build_week_NBCCA)
It accepts unencoded data, integers as well as strings, but I haven't done very extensive testing.
